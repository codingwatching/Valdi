# Getting set up to contribute to Valdi

> **Most users:** Install the CLI from npm and use `valdi dev_setup` — see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). This page is for contributors who are developing Valdi itself (the framework), not just building Valdi apps.

Follow all instructions in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

Run `dev_setup.sh`

```sh
../scripts/dev_setup.sh
```
